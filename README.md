# Project Introduction

This project is under Dr. Robert Stevens at the Laboratory for Computational Intensive Care Medicine at Johns Hopkins University.

The purpose behind the project is to create a deep learning model that can reliably detect lesions in CT scans of acute ischemic stroke patients. Small lesions are notoriously difficult to find in CT scans, and usually require an MRI scan to see, a process which takes time that patients may not have. Our project aims to find a way to locate lesions without the need for MRIs

This repository represents an fork of the original repository, which is being tested by undergraduate researcher Ansh Goyal under the guidance of graduate research Xinyuan Fang and Dr. Robert Stevens.
